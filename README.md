## not coalpha ai

Those microbes at [CoAlpha.Ai](https://github.com/coalphaai) stole my username!
I actually find it kind of amusing that my username is associated with such a *sophisticated* buzzword such as "AI".
Anyways, I write code as a hobby because I'm not good at anything else.
Stuff I'm working on or proud of stays in [@coalpha](https://github.com/coalpha?tab=repositories).
If I'm finished or abandoning a project/repo, it gets moved to [@coarchive](https://github.com/coarchive).
I'm also attending college at a college. Thus, [@coallege](https://github.com/coallege).
